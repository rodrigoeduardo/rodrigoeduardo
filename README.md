I'm an enthusiast of technology and programming. Currently, I'm graduating in Information Technology @ UFRN and I'm working as a fullstack developer @ Bitflow Finance! 💻

I live in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil 🌴

I really love challenges and to keep improving and learning new stuff every time! 🚀

My favorite technologies are [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)!
