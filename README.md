## Hello, everybody 😁

I'm an enthusiast of technology and programming. Currently, I study IT at IFRN - Campus Parnamirim and I pursue my dream to be a great Web Developer! 💻

18 years old 🤠

I live in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil 🌴

## What I Love 💜

I really love challenges and to keep improving and learning new stuff every time! 🚀

My favorite technologies are [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)!!

"We are part of the universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us."
