I'm an enthusiast of technology and programming. Currently, I study IT at UFRN and I pursue my dream to be a great Web Developer! ðŸ’»

I live in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil ðŸŒ´

I really love challenges and to keep improving and learning new stuff every time! ðŸš€

My favorite technologies are [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)!

Check out my [portfolio](https://rodrigoeduardo.vercel.app)!

"We are part of the universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us."
